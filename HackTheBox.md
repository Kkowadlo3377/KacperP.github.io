A list of my completed HackTheBox boxes. I will also have my writeups/walkthroughs for retired ones.

| Box Name  | Difficulty | Status | Platform | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Bounty Hunter | Easy | Complete | Linux | A little difficult, but very fun |
| Cap | Easy | Complete | Linux | Very easy and good introductory box |
| Horizontall  | Easy | Complete | Linux | A lot harder than other easy ones |
| Knife | Easy | Complete | Linux | Kinda weird, didn't like it too much |
